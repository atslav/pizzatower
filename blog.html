        There are 2 playable characters in total Peppino and Gustavo. Well... it's three with the rat, BUT there were plans for having more characters. Like Pepperman the first floor boss, or the Vigilante the second floor boss. Well actually most of the playable planned playable characters are bosses now. Except for the final boss.

          He is a sous-chef gnome that works with peppino! And he also has a pet rat called Brick the rat! Really cool! First time when you see them in game Gustavo runs in circles away from Brick. On the next floor they start fighting and then on the other floor they settle their differences and become buddies.
